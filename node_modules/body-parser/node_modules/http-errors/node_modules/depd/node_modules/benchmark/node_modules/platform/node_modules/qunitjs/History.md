  * Update package.json
  * Partially revert af27eae841c3e1c01c46de72d676f1047e1ee375 - can't move reset around, so also don't wrap in try-catch, as the result of that is effectively swallowed. Can't output the result as the outputting is already done.
  * Add QUnit.pushFailure to log error conditions like exceptions. Accepts stacktrace as second argument, allowing extraction with catched exceptions (useful even in Safari). Remove old fail() function that would just log to console, not useful anymore as regular test output is much more useful by now. Move up QUnit.reset() call to just make that another failed assertion. Used to not make a test fail. Fixes #210
  * Update equals and same deprecations to use QUnit.push to provide correct source lines. Fixes #211
  * Add a test file for narwhal integration. Has to use print instead of console.log. Fails when an assertion fails, something about setInterval...

  * Add a simple test file to check basic nodejs integration works
  * Check for global object to find setTimeout in node
  * Fix CommonJS export by assigning QUnit to module.exports.
  * Remove the testEnvironmentArg to test(). Most obscure, never used anywhere. test() is still heavily overloaded with argument shifting, this makes it a little more sane. Fixes #172
  * Serialize expected and actual values only when test fails. Speeds up output of valid tests, especially for lots of large objects. Fixes #183
  * Fix sourceFromsStacktrace to get the right line in Firefox. Shift the 'error' line away in Chrome to get a match.
  * Fix references to test/deepEqual.js
  * In autorun mode, moduleDone is called without matching moduleStart. Fix issue #184

  * Fix bad global in reset()
  * Some cleanup in theme addons

  * Can't rely on outerHTML for Firefox < 11. Use cloneNode instead.
  * Merge remote branch 'conzett/master'
  * Cleanup whitespace
  * Update sessionStorage support test to latest version from Modernizr, trying to setItem to avoid QUOTA_EXCEEDED_EXCEPTION

  * Using node-qunit port, the start/stop function are not exposed so we need to prefix any call to them with 'QUnit'. Aka: start() -> QUnit.start()
  * Remove the 'let teardown clean up globals test' - IE<9 doesn't support (==buggy) deleting window properties, and that's not worth the trouble, as everything else passes just fine. Fixes #155
  * Fix globals in test.js, part 2
  * Fix globals in test.js. ?tell wwalser to use ?noglobals every once in a while
  * Extend readme regarding release process

1.1.0 / 2011-10-11
==================

  * Fixes #134 - Add a window.onerror handler. Makes uncaught errors actually fail the testsuite, instead of going by unnoticed.
  * Whitespace cleanup
  * Merge remote branch 'trevorparscal/master'
  * Fixed IE compatibility issues with using toString on NodeList objects, which in some browsers results in [object Object] rather than [object NodeList]. Now using duck typing for NodeList objects based on the presence of length, length being a number, presence of item method (which will be typeof string in IE and function in others, so we just check that it's not undefined) and that item(0) returns the same value as [0], unless it's empty, in which case item(0) will return 0, while [0] would return undefined. Tested in IE6, IE8, Firefox 6, Safari 5 and Chrome 16.
  * Update readme with basic notes on releases
  * More whitespace/parens cleanup
  * Check if setTimeout is available before trying to delay running the next task. Fixes #160

  * Whitespace cleanup
  * Merge remote branch 'mmchaney/master'
  * Merge remote branch 'Krinkle/master'
  * Using === instead of ==
  * Added more strict array type detection for dump output, and allowed NodeList objects to be output as arrays
  * Fixes a bug where after an async test, assertions could move between test cases because of internal state (config.current) being incorrectly set
  * Simplified check for assertion count and adjusted whitespace
  * Redo of fixing issue #156 (Support Object.prototype extending environment). * QUnit.diff: Throws exception without this if Object.prototype is set (Property 'length' of undefined. Since Object.prototype.foo doesn't have a property 'rows') * QUnit.url: Without this fix, if Object.prototype.foo is set, the url will be set to ?foo=...&the=rest. * saveGlobals: Without this fix, whenever a member is added to Object.prototype, saveGlobals will think it was a global variable in this loop. --- This time using the call method instead of obj.hasOwnProperty(key), which may fail if the object has that as it's own property (touché!).
  * Handle expect(0) as expected, i.e. expect(0); ok(true, foo); will cause a test to fail

  * Drop support for deprecated #main in favor of #qunit-fixture. If this breaks your testsuite, replace id="main" with id="qunit-fixture". Fixes #103
  * Remove the same key as the one being set. Partial fix for #101
  * Don't modify expected-count when checking pollution. The failing assertion isn't expected, so shouldn't be counted. And if expect wasn't used, the count is misleading.
  * Fix order of noglobals check to produce correct introduced/delete error messages
  * Prepend module name to sessionStorage keys to avoid conflicts
  * Store filter-tests only when checked
  * Write to sessionStorage only bad tests
  * Moved QUnit.url() definition after QUnit properties are merged into the global scope. Fixes #93 - QUnit url/extend function breaking urls in jQuery ajax test component
  * Add a "Rerun" link to each test to replace the dblclick (still supported, for now).
  * Fixed the regex for parsing the name of a test when double clicking to filter.
  * Merge remote branch 'scottgonzalez/url'
  * Added checkboxes to show which flags are currently on and allow toggling them.
  * Retain all querystring parameters when filtering a test via double click.
  * Added better querystring parsing. Now storing all querystring params in QUnit.urlParams so that we can carry the params forward when filtering to a specific test. This removes the ability to specify multiple filters.
  * Make reordering optional (QUnit.config.reorder = false) and optimize "Hide passed tests" mode by also hiding "Running [testname]" entries.
  * Added missing semicolons and wrapped undefined key in quotes.
  * Optimize test hiding, add class on page load if stored in sessionStorage
  * Optimize the hiding of passed tests.
  * Position test results above test list, making it visible without ever having to scroll. Create a placeholder to avoid pushing down results later.
  * Don't check for existing qunit-testresult element, it gets killed on init anyway.
  * Added URL flag ?notrycatch (ala ?noglobals) for debugging exceptions. Won't try/catch test code, giving better debugging changes on the original exceptions. Fixes #72
  * Always show qunit-toolbar (if at all specified), persist checkbox via sessionStorage. Fixes #47
  * Use non-html testname for calls to fail(). Fixes #77
  * Overhaul of QUnit.callbacks. Consistent single argument with related properties, with additional runtime property for QUnit.done
  * Extended test/logs.html to capture more of the callbacks.
  * Fixed moduleStart/Done callbacks. Added test/logs.html to test these callbacks. To be extended.
  * Update copyright and license header. Fixes #61
  * Formatting fix.
  * Use a semaphore to synchronize stop() and start() calls. Fixes #76
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/paulirish/qunit into paulirish-master
  * Added two tests for previous QUnit.raises behaviour. For #69
  * add optional 2. arg to QUnit.raises #69.
  * fix references inside Complex Instances Nesting to what was originally intended.
  * Qualify calls to ok() in raises() for compatibility with CLI environments.
  * Fix done() handling, check for blocking, not block property
  * Fix moduleStart/Done and done callbacks.
  * Replacing sessionStorage test with the one from Modernizr/master (instead of current release). Here's hoping it'll work for some time.
  * Updated test for availability of sessionStorage, based on test from Modernizr. Fixes #64
  * Defer test execution when previous run passed, persisted via sessionStorage. Fixes #49
  * Refactored module handling and queuing to enable selective defer of test runs.
  * Move assertions property from config to Test
  * Move expected-tests property from config to Test
  * Refactored test() method to delegate to a Test object to encapsulate all properties and methods of a single test, allowing further modifications.
  * Adding output of sourcefile and linenumber of failed assertions (except ok()). Only limited cross-browser support for now. Fixes #60
  * Drop 'hide missing tests' feature. Fixes #48
  * Adding readme. Fixes #58
  * Merge branch 'prettydiff'
  * Improve jsDump output with formatted diffs.
  * Cleanup whitespace
  * Cleanup whitespace
  * Added additional guards around browser specific code and cleaned up jsDump code
  * Added guards around tests which are only for browsers
  * cleaned up setTimeout undefined checking and double done on test finish
  * fixing .gitignore
  * making window setTimeout query more consistent
  * Moved expect-code back to beginning of function, where it belongs. Fixes #52
  * Bread crumb in header: Link to suite without filters, add link to current page based on the filter, if present. Fixes #50
  * Make the toolbar element optional when checking for show/hide of test results. Fixes #46
  * Adding headless.html to manually test logging and verify that QUnit works without output elements. Keeping #qunit-fixture as a few tests actually use that.
  * Fix for QUnit.moduleDone, get rid of initial bogus log. Fixes #33
  * Pass raw data (result, message, actual, expected) as third argument to QUnit.log. Fixes #32
  * Dump full exception. Not pretty, but functional (see issue Pretty diff for pretty output). Fixes #31
  * Don't let QUnit.reset() cause assertions to run. Manually applied from Scott Gonzalez branch. Fixes #34
  * Added missing semicolons. Fixes #37
  * Show okay/failed instead of undefined. Fixes #38
  * Expose push as QUnit.push to build custom assertions. Fixes #39
  * Respect filter pass selection when writing new results. Fixes #43
  * Cleanup tests, removing asyncTest-undefined check and formatting
  * Reset: Fall back to innerHTML when jQuery isn't available. Fixes #44
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jquery/qunit
  * reset doesn't exist here - fixes #28.
  * - less css cruft, better readability - replaced inline style for test counts with "counts" class - test counts now use a "failed"/"passed" vs "pass"/"fail", shorter/more distinct selectors - pulled all test counts styling together and up (they're always the same regardless of section pass/fail state)
  * Adding .gitignore file
  * Removing diff test - diffing works fine, as the browser collapses whitespace in its output, but the test can't do that and isn't worth fixing.
  * Always synchronize the done-step (it'll set the timeout when necessary), fixes timing race conditions.
  * Insert location.href as an anchor around the header. Fixes issue #29
  * - kill double ;; in escapeHtml. oops
  * Removed html escaping from QUnit.diff, as input is already escaped, only leads to double escaping. Replaced newlines with single whitespace.
  * Optimized and cleaned up CSS file
  * Making the reset-method non-global (only module, test and assertions should be global), and fixing the fixture reset by using jQuery's html() method again, doesn't work with innerHTML, yet
  * Introducing #qunit-fixture element, deprecating the (never documented) #main element. Doesn't require inline styles and is now independent of jQuery.
  * Amending previous commit: Remove jQuery-core specific resets (will be replaced within jQuery testsuite). Fixes issue #19 - QUnit.reset() removes global jQuery ajax event handlers
  * Remove jQuery-core specific resets (will be replaced within jQuery testsuite). Fixes issue #19 - QUnit.reset() removes global jQuery ajax event handlers
  * Cleaning up rubble from the previous commit.
  * Added raises assertion, reusing some of kensnyder's code.
  * Merged kensnyder's object detection code. Origina
