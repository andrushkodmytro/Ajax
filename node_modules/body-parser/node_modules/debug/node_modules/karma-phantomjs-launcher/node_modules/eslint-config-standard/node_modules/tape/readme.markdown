# example

``` js
var test = require('tape');

test('timing test', function (t) {
    t.plan(2);
    
    t.equal(typeof Date.now, 'function');
    var start = Date.now();
    
    setTimeout(function () {
        t.equal(Date.now() - start, 100);
    }, 100);
});
```

```
$ node example/timing.js
TAP version 13
# timing test
ok 1 should be equal
not ok 2 should be equal
  ---
    operator: equal
    expected: 100
    actual:   107
  ...

1..2
# tests 2
# pass  1
# fail  1
```

# usage

You always need to `require('tape')` in test files. You can run the tests by
usual node means (`require('test-file.js')` or `node test-file.js`). You can
also run tests using the `tape` binary to utilize globbing, on Windows for
example:

```sh
$ tape tests/**/*.js
```

`tape`'s arguments are passed to the
[`glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) module. If you want `glob` to
perform the expansion on a system where the shell performs such expansion, quote
the arguments as necessary:

```sh
$ tape 'tests/**/*.js'
$ tape "tests/**/*.js"
```

## Preloading modules

Additionally, it is possible to make `tape` load one or more modules before running any tests, by using the `-r` or `--require` flag. Here's an example that loads [babel-register](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/require/) before running any tests, to allow for JIT compilation:

```sh
$ tape -r babel-register tests/**/*.js
```

Depending on the module you're loading, you may be able to paramaterize it using environment variables or auxiliary files. Babel, for instance, will load options from [`.babelrc`](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/) at runtime.

The `-r` flag behaves exactly like node's `require`, and uses the same module resolution algorithm. This means that if you need to load local modules, you have to prepend their path with `./` or `../` accordingly.

For example:

```sh
$ tape -r ./my/local/module tests/**/*.js
```

Please note that all modules loaded using the `-r` flag will run *before* any tests, regardless of when they are specified. For example, `tape -r a b -r c` will actually load `a` and `c` *before* loading `b`, since they are flagged as required modules.

# things that go well with tape

tape maintains a fairly minimal core. Additional features are usually added by using another module alongside tape.

## pretty reporters

The default TAP output is good for machines and humans that are robots.

If you want a more colorful / pretty output there are lots of modules on npm
that will output something pretty if you pipe TAP into them:

 - https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-dot
 - https://github.com/substack/faucet

 - https://github.com/gummesson/tap-json

To use them, try `node test/index.js | tap-spec` or pipe it into one
of the modules of your choice!

## uncaught exceptions

By default, uncaught exceptions in your tests will not be intercepted, and will cause tape to crash. If you find this behavior undesirable, use [tape-catch](https://github.com/michaelrhodes/tape-catch) to report any exceptions as TAP errors.

# methods

The assertion methods in tape are heavily influenced or copied from the methods
in [node-tap](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap).

```
var test = require('tape')
```

## test([name], [opts], cb)

Create a new test with an optional `name` string and optional `opts` object.
`cb(t)` fires with the new test object `t` once all preceding tests have
finished. Tests execute serially.

Available `opts` options are:
- opts.skip = true/false. See test.skip.
- opts.timeout = 500. Set a timeout for the test, after which it will fail.
  See test.timeoutAfter.
- opts.objectPrintDepth = 5. Configure max depth of expected / actual object
  printing. Environmental variable `NODE_TAPE_OBJECT_PRINT_DEPTH` can set the
  desired default depth for all tests; locally-set values will take precedence.

If you forget to `t.plan()` out how many assertions you are going to run and you
don't call `t.end()` explicitly, your test will hang.

## test.skip(name, cb)

Generate a new test that will be skipped over.

## test.onFinish(fn)

The onFinish hook will get invoked when ALL tape tests have finished
right before tape is about to print the test summary.

## test.onFailure(fn)

The onFailure hook will get invoked whenever any tape tests has failed.

## t.plan(n)

Declare that `n` assertions should be run. `t.end()` will be called
automatically after the `n`th assertion. I
